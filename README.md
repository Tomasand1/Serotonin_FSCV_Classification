# Serotonin FSCV classification

Development of Neural Networks to classify FSCV serotonin data.

## Installation

To run the application, navigate to the `/src` folder.

To create an environment and install the dependencies required for the project, use:

```bash
make create_environment

conda activate SerotoninLevelDetection

make requirements
```

If the dependencies fail to install for any reason, they can be installed manually.

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, use the following script to run the application locally:

```
python .
```

The application will run in the command line. The simple interface is provided.
